# Movie_Emotion

This is an attempt to understand the impact of movie poster on its popularity. The original ipython file was too long, so I decided to cut it into half. What you see here are **Data Collection** and **Analysis** parts. Please start with the **Data Collection** if you are insterested in knowing how I scraped and collected the data. You can also read more about how I did **Emotion Exraction** in that same file. If you are, however, only interested in the analysis part, start by reading through the **Analysis** ipython file. 

Like Always, please considering sharing your thoughts about my work by emailing me at [foad.yousef@gmail.com](mailto:foad.yousef@gmail.com).

Cheers!
